# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to summarize the ride-sharing data by city type.  The deliverables for this analysis include:
1. A ride-sharing summary by city type (urban, suburban, rural) including total rides, total drivers, total fares, avg fare per ride and avg fare per driver; and
2. A multiple-line chart summarizing total fares for each city type over Jan to Apr 2019 time period.

My code and results for this analysis can be found here: https://github.com/legeren/PyBer_Analysis/blob/6755747e7cbaf314d7d1a773630d67be3d5c6860/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb

## Results:
As seen in this screenshot, there are three city types (urban, suburban and rural) which have quite the disparity in number of rides, number of drivers and total fares, avg fare per ride and driver.

## Summary:
Based on the summarized data in this analysis, my three business recommendations for the CEO to address disparities among city types are:
1. There is opportunity to raise fares in urban city types as there is a 70% difference in average fare per driver ($16.57 vs $55.49) between urban and rural city types.
2. Late February time frame seems to be the most profitable for all city types consistently.  It may be beneficial to understand what event is causing this anomaly and increase the driver availability/fares.  (See diagram for context) https://github.com/legeren/PyBer_Analysis/blob/6755747e7cbaf314d7d1a773630d67be3d5c6860/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png
3. Demand is low in rural city types (only 125 rides for the time period).  Despite the average fare being higher than other city types, there is no need to increase drivers as the demand is already sufficiently met.
